# Hi Penny dear!
You wanted an email, but this is easier. The Internet already did most of the work for me.

So, without further ado,

<h2 align="center">Welcome to Penny Data Science</h2>
<h4 align="center">A hub where you can git a look at all the courses you need</h4>

By the way, did you know you can (and should) edit this? Get your GitHub account set up and you can edit this page as you make decisions and take courses.

- [Future Classes](#future-classes)
- [OSSU Program Contents](#ossu-program-contents)

## Goals
Simply put, what do you want to accomplish? We should spend a little bit of time trying to figure this out.

But don't feel like you have to get EVERYTHING figured out. All paths forward lead through the same waypoints. You'll need linear algebra, probability, statistics, and Python or R programming. As long as you stay in this domain, those are the next places you need to go. So if you want to make a little bit of progress, then just pick one or two and do 'em.

### Finishing a bachelor's degree?
If you want to pick up degree work again next semester or in the summer, then we'll both feel a lot better if you've already done some pre-study so you don't feel overwhelmed.

Options include:
- Linear algebra
- Probability and/or statistics
- [Real analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_analysis)

### Going to grad school?
Well, you'll need to get into a grad school.

Here are a few grad school options that should appeal to you: (TODO)
- Colorado State University -- Master of Applied Statistics (here, and online, and awesome!) | [Program Page](https://mas.colostate.edu/statistical-science/) | Github Page (TODO)
- Georgia Tech -- Online Master of Science Analysis (cheap, and online via edX! and awesome!) | [Program Page](https://pe.gatech.edu/degrees/analytics) | [edX Page with more info](https://www.edx.org/masters/online-master-science-analytics-georgia-tech) | [Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSA/)
- Michigan State
- Northwestern
- probably some other ones

In order to get in to a grad school, you'll need to take (at a minimum) the following courses:
- Undergrad linear algebra (required by CSU and Georgia Tech)
- Undergrad statistics (required by CSU and Georgia Tech)
- Python programming (required by Georgia Tech who specifically recommends [CS1301](https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/introduction-to-computing-in-python))

### Just want to go get a data analysis job?
Then what you actually need is a data science bootcamp. (TODO)

But before that, you should take a data science bootcamp prep course. (TODO)

### I want to learn all these things, and I don't want to spend even a single penny.
That's the entire point of the Open Source Society University! OSSU is a path to a free, self-taught education in Computer Science, Data Science, or a couple of other tracks. All you have to do is take the free resources and courses shown in [this section down here](#ossu-program-contents). Sounds easy, right? Well.... yes, but you *do* have to take them.

## Progress So Far
You've come a long way, baby. Here's what you already have DONE and out of the way:
- Pre-calculus
- Calculus 1
- Calculus 2
- Calculus 3 / multivariate
- Differential Equations
- Discrete Math
- Computer Programming (Java)
- Computer Science 1: Control Flow and Objects
- Computer Science 2: Data Structures

## How to use this guide

### Order of the classes

This guide was developed to be consumed in a linear approach. What does this mean? That you should complete one course at a time.

The courses are **already** in the order that you should complete them. Just start in the [Linear Algebra](#linear-algebra) section and after finishing the first course, start the next one.

**If the course isn't open, do it anyway with the resources from the previous class.**

### Should I take all courses?

**Yes!** The intention is to conclude **all** the courses listed here!

### Which programming languages should I use?

Python and R are heavily used in Data Science community and our courses teach you both, but...

The **important** thing for each course is to **internalize** the **core concepts** and to be able to use them with whatever tool (programming language) that you wish.

## Prerequisite

The **only things** that you need to know are how to use **Git** and **GitHub**. Here are some resources to learn about them:

**Note**: Just pick one of the courses below to learn the basics. You will learn a lot more once you get started!

- [Try Git](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)
- [Git - the simple guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)
- [GitHub Training & Guides](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLg7s6cbtAD15G8lNyoaYDuKZSKyJrgwB-)
